# TODO



## completed
[x] load glb (took lot more effort than explained here, created this afterwards)
[x] (glb rendering) load data to opengl
[x] (glb rendering) render skeletal view
[x] (glb rendering) load texture data to opengl
[x] (glb rendering) render textures
[x] (research) how does one vao per mesh works
[x] (gltf loading) gltf buffers

## working on
[ ] (animtions) morph targets

## upcoming
[ ] (gltf loading) test gltf loader
[ ] (housekeeping) gltf buffer mem leak
[ ] (animations) inverse kinematics
[ ] (glb loading) extensions/extra glb storage
[ ] (research) quaternions
[ ] (glb rendering) lighting : https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Colors
[ ] (glb rendering) normal texture
[ ] (glb rendering) occlusion texture
[ ] (glb rendering) roughness texture

## wants
[ ] (gltf loading) textures that are not bfviews
[ ] (glb rendering) https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Instancing

## quality of life
[ ] (glb rendering) reflection textures
[ ] (glb rendering) when material uses multiple texcoords ie texcoord_1 (make larger VAO)
[ ] (glb rendering) texture double sided (gl_FrontFacing)
[ ] (gltf loading) load gltf v1
